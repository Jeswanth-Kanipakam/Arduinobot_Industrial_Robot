[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_ros_planning_interface.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "moveit_ros_planning_interface", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_ros_planning_interface" with any of the following names:

    moveit_ros_planning_interfaceConfig.cmake
    moveit_ros_planning_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_ros_planning_interface" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "moveit_ros_planning_interface_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "moveit_ros_planning_interface"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
